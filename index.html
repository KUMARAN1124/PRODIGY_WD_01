                    <h2>What is Jallikattu?</h2>
                    <p>Jallikattu, also known as Eruthazhuvuthal or Manju Virattu, is a traditional bull-taming event that has been a crucial part of Tamil culture for over 2,000 years. It is held during the Pongal festival, a celebration of the harvest season, and takes place in villages across Tamil Nadu. The name "Jallikattu" is derived from the Tamil words "salli" (coins) and "kattu" (package), which were awarded to the victors.</p>

                    <h2>The Event</h2>
                    <p>In Jallikattu, participants, often young men, attempt to embrace and hold onto the hump of a bull for a specified distance or time. Unlike bullfighting, the objective is not to harm the bull but to showcase the bravery and skill of the participants. The bulls used in Jallikattu are specifically bred for this purpose and are considered symbols of strength and resilience.</p>
                    <p>Jallikattu is more than a sport; it is a cultural festival that highlights the agricultural lifestyle and traditional values of Tamil society. It plays a significant role in village life, promoting community bonding, valor, and respect for livestock. The bulls involved are highly revered and often treated as part of the family, receiving the best care and attention.</p>
